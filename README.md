# node-io-practice
This is a coding project I completed as part of an interview process. The coding project tested knowledge of Node.js, recursion, file I/O, and most importantly, creating dependency trees.


## Objective:
The objective of the project was the following:

* Read an input file (`org_chart_sample.in`), a CSV-like file with data about an imaginary organization's employees.
* Parse the input, given a predefined pattern:
  * line 1 has the number of rows (test cases) to expect
  * Each test case has employees (name, supervisor name, Title, Year started), separated by "--"
* Create a dependency tree starting with CEO, and write file to disk (`org_chart_sample.out`).

## Files
* [final.js](./final.js) - The code
* [org_chart_sample.in](./org_chart_sample.in) - Given input data
* [org_chart_sample.out](./org_chart_sample.out) - Output generated by `final.js`

## Running
```
$ node ./final.js
```
**Note:** `org_chart_sample.out` will be overwritten.
